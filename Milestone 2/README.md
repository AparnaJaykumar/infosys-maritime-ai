# FreightQuote AI — Milestone 2

**Infosys Springboard Internship 7.0 · Batch 4 · Team 02**

> 📘 **Illustrated notebook documentation:** [Open README.ipynb](README.ipynb) for the complete step-by-step explanation, 18 SQL Copilot patterns, role permissions, deployment instructions and **all 50 annotated screenshots**. This Markdown README is also kept for GitHub compatibility.

FreightQuote AI is an ocean-freight workspace for building quotations, comparing carriers, reviewing routes, checking weather and customs requirements, and asking **database-grounded** questions through a SQL Copilot. Milestone 2 extends the provided freight application with **secure accounts, five user roles, profiles, administration, an improved SQL Copilot and a consistent interface**.

> **What was provided versus added:** The original reference notebook already contained the six freight agents, a basic SQL Copilot, FastAPI and freight data. This milestone integrates Milestone 1 authentication and introduces multi-user controls, RBAC, account management, profiles, Copilot question coverage and interface improvements. It does not claim to have created the six agents from scratch.

## Features

| Area | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Accounts** | Customer self-registration, bcrypt password hashes, six-digit email verification, strong password checks and JWT sessions. Public registration does **not** grant privileged roles. |
| **Recovery & lockout** | Password recovery by email OTP or security question. After five failed sign-ins, an administrator must unlock the account. OTP requests are rate-limited. |
| **Profiles** | View role, email, join date and recent login. Change username or password after current-password validation. |
| **Five-role RBAC** | Server-side access permissions for Admin, Operations Manager, Freight Broker, Auditor and Customer; denied requests receive HTTP 403. |
| **Admin console** | Provision users, assign or update roles, link customer records, lock/unlock accounts and review activity logs. |
| **SQL Copilot** | Natural-language-style freight question patterns execute **predefined/parameterized SQL**, returning exact database rows and the query/row count. It is not a general-purpose LLM and does not answer every question. |
| **Voice controls** | Browser microphone dictation for asking questions and optional text-to-speech for answers, subject to browser permissions/support. |
| **Freight agents** | Existing Route AI, Spot Quotes, Carriers, Weather Risk, Margin and Customs modules remain in the integrated application. |
| **Theme** | Consistent light/dark design and role-specific navigation. |

### The freight workflow

1. A permitted user selects an origin/destination, cargo, weight, HS code and customer.
2. The existing quote pipeline evaluates the route, weather, carrier and pricing, then customs/documentation and approval conditions.
3. The quote page shows price, margin, ETA, status and (where available) an agent trace or generated documents.
4. Authorized users investigate holds or supporting data in the related modules.

**Data provenance:** The Weather Risk UI identifies **Open-Meteo weather/marine information** as live/cached, but **vessel positions are simulated** and **congestion is model-predicted** unless a real data source is connected. The *Inject Storm* control is a test scenario, not a verified storm. Illustrative quotes on the public landing page are not commercial offers.

## Role permissions

| Role | Copilot | Route | Quotes | Carriers | Weather | Margin | Customs | Run agents | Manage users |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Operations Manager | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Freight Broker | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Auditor (read-only) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Customer (scoped) | ✓ | — | **Own** | — | — | — | — | — | — |

The administrator assigns roles; the role selected on the **sign-in form is checked against the account's existing assignment**, not used to grant a new role. Customers cannot view other customers' quotes or unrestricted SQL results. Auditor review screens may show document controls, but the server-side permission checks determine which mutations are allowed.

## Real website screenshots

## How to run it

### Run in Google Colab

1. Open **`FreightQuote_AI_Milestone2_Final_Deployment.ipynb`** in Google Colab.
2. Add `JWT_SECRET` (a strong random secret) and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to Colab **Secrets**. Add `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` for live email verification; these should be an application password/SMTP credentials, **not** credentials placed in code.
3. Run the notebook top to bottom. The fixed startup uses Colab's existing Python environment rather than creating an `ensurepip` virtual environment.
4. Open the notebook's displayed application URL. Complete the customer account verification flow, or sign in using an administrator account initialized from your own secure settings.
5. If a runtime reset occurs, rerun the notebook's recovery/startup cells. **Colab runtime storage is temporary** unless you explicitly configure persistence.

**Never commit secrets, token files, SQLite databases with real users, or Colab output logs to GitHub.** See **Run in Google Colab** and **Run with Docker** above for full notes.

### Run with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in strong JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env; add SMTP credentials if needed.
docker compose up --build
```

See `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, and `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`. Confirm host/port and secrets in your deployment environment before publishing a public endpoint. Docker is an alternative packaging path; the final demonstration was run from the notebook.

## Validation and limitations

- The updated notebook includes the earlier **Colab Python 3.13 / `ensurepip` startup fix**.
- Role checks must be enforced on the backend, not just by hiding sidebar buttons. Incorrectly selected sign-in roles are not a way to acquire permissions.
- The Copilot uses **freight-specific SQL patterns** with graceful handling for unsupported questions or empty results. Speech recognition depends on browser support and microphone permission.
- External weather feeds, SMTP, public tunnel URLs and actual Colab/Docker runtime behavior require separate live verification before production use.
- The application is an internship prototype; do not assume commercial availability, complete production hardening, or real AIS tracking.
- If the app shows a quote lookup with zero rows, it means no matching records were available under the query criteria; it is not evidence of a fabricated answer.

For automated checks, see `tests/test_release.py`. Live Colab, email and microphone checks must be repeated in the deployment environment.

## Team contributions

| Collaborator | Contribution to Milestone 2 |
|---|---|
| **Tirth Thakkar** | Integrated the Milestone 1 landing page into Aparna's codebase, improved the UI and ensured consistent role-specific styling. |
| **Alisetti Ranga Triveni** | Built the Profile page, including edit flows, validation, saved changes and agreed role-specific views. |
| **Aparna Pulimoottil Jaykumar** | Completed the Admin Dashboard and implemented server-side RBAC enforcement across all five roles. |
| **Shivam Kumar** | Fine-tuned the SQL Copilot, connected the relevant data and handled errors, empty results and unsupported questions. |

**Attribution:** The six original freight agents and initial SQL Copilot are inherited from the Milestone 2 reference project. Team contributions above describe enhancements and integrations, not ownership of the original baseline.

## GitHub submission

**Extract `Milestone 2.zip` and upload the extracted files/folders to the root of your GitHub repository.** GitHub does *not* automatically unpack a dragged-and-dropped ZIP; uploading the ZIP alone will not render this README or its screenshots. On GitHub, the screenshots are embedded from relative paths so the gallery opens correctly.
